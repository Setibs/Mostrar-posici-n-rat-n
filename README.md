## Are you tired of using packages like pyautogui through the terminal to determine which pixels you're pointing at?
### That's why I created this draggable GUI, which shows in real time the current location of your mouse on the screen.
Simply run main.py or create an executable using the pyinstaller command "pyinstaller --windowed --onedir --icon=icon.ico main.py," and you're good to go.
You can also use the --onefile argument, but please note that it might slow down startup.
